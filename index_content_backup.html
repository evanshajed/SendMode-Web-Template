			<p>SendMode's <strong>mobile number DB cleaning service (or HLR lookup service)</strong> allows you to identify old, invalid and ported mobile numbers from your list. This allows you to reduce costs by sending your messages only to valid and live mobile numbers.</p>
			<p>Mobile number lookup provides a complete solution to the ongoing problem of poor quality mobile number lists and the need to identify ported numbers in your mobile numbers database. This service identifies invalid numbers, numbers which are experiencing a temporary problem preventing them from receiving SMS, and can also determine whether a number has been ported to another network.</p>
